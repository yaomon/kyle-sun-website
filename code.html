The player takes control of a stationary turret with limited vertical movement, and they must protect the land from the surge of incoming zombies. They must collect and utilize a huge variety of weapons, ranging from fist cannons to chicken launchers to parasite guns. Precise aiming and knowing when to use which weapon will ensure victory, though the player must be aware of multiple types of zombies that fly, sprint, and even hurl boulders. If the player turret fails to dodge and destroy the undead, then the player will surely join them.</span>
