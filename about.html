           <p id = "info">Hello! I am a 22-year-old computer science major.<br>I play games. I develop games. I draw. I program. You probably already know all that from looking at the rest of the website, so what else is left? I would be lying if I said I have realistic expectations and goals. Afterall, I find no fun in life without some absurd, overly-ambitious dream to clamor after. Of course, I'm not promising to '<i>change the world</i>' or '<i>take mankind forward into the next step of evolution</i>' or '<i>become the unwavering cornerstone in the castle of progression that will be built into the very fabric of history starting from today</i>', but I do believe that something more can be done with games. Our world is far from perfect. Messages relayed through various mediums is a great way to do something about our society's shortcomings. There is no better medium to impact an audience than games. That is where I am headed, using games as a bridge for understanding and hopefully I can do a little bit to make this world just a tad better. Plus games are awesome and really fun to make and play! :)<br><br>
